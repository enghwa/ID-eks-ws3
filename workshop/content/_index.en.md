Running containers in the AWS Cloud allows you to build robust, scalable applications and services. Join AWS for a deep dive into running containers using Amazon EKS, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and AWS Fargate. Throughout this day long workshop, our container experts will host live demonstrations and hands-on labs covering what you need to know to get started and build modern applications using containers in the cloud.
